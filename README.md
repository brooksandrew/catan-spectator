Record games of Settlers of Catan for research purposes, replay purposes, broadcast purposes, etc.

This project introduces a machine-parsable, human-readable file format for describing a game of Catan.

This is a work in progress.

### Usage

```
$ python3 main.py
```

### Demo
![Demo](/doc/gifs/demo.gif)

### File Format

Each `.catan` file contains all publicly known information in the game.
Therefore, each `.catan` file contains sufficient information to 'replay' a game (from a spectator's point of view).

The header begins with a version, and ends with `...CATAN!`. The game begins after that.

Example
