Transcribe games of Settlers of Catan for research purposes, replay purposes, broadcast purposes, etc.

This project introduces a machine-parsable, human-readable file format for describing a game of Catan.

This is a work in progress.

### Usage

```
$ python3 main.py --help
usage: main.py [-h] [--terrain TERRAIN] [--numbers NUMBERS] [--ports PORTS]
               [--pieces PIECES] [--players PLAYERS] [--pregame PREGAME]

log a game of catan

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --terrain TERRAIN  random|preset|empty|debug, default empty
  --numbers NUMBERS  random|preset|empty|debug, default empty
  --ports PORTS      random|preset|empty|debug, default preset
  --pieces PIECES    random|preset|empty|debug, default empty
  --players PLAYERS  random|preset|empty|debug, default preset
  --pregame PREGAME  on|off, default on
```

Make targets:
- `make relaunch`: launch (or relaunch) the GUI
- `make logs`: cat the python logs
- `make tail`: tail the python logs
- `make`: alias for relaunch && tail

### Demo

### File Format

Each `.catan` file contains all publicly known information in the game.
Therefore, each `.catan` file contains sufficient information to 'replay' a game (from a spectator's point of view).

The header begins with a version, and ends with `...CATAN!`. The game begins after that.

Tiles are numbered 1 through 19 starting from the most northwest tile and spiralling countercockwise inward.
See module hexgrid (`hexgrid.py`) for details.

The format is not yet v1.0. The current version is listed in `catanlog.py`.

See `catanlog.CatanLog` (in `catanlog.py`) for all available actions, along with their format.

### Todo

Core
- [x] robber move, steal from player (account for steal from nobody case)
- [x] trading with people
- [x] trading with port
- [x] knight -> robber move, steal from player
- [x] ports configurable
- [x] fix victory points do not work first click each turn
- [x] robber movable during game setup
- [x] implement year of plenty dev card
- [x] catanlog: if a 2 is rolled, syntax is “$color rolls 2 …DEUCES!”
- [x] modules documented
- [ ] views documented

Nice to have
- [ ] board: random number setup obeys red number rule
- [ ] ui+board+hexgrid: during piece placement, use little red x’s (at least in debug mode) on “killed spots”
- [ ] ui+game+player+states: dev cards, i.e. keep a count of how many dev cards a player has played and enable Play Dev Card buttons if num > 0
- [ ] ui+game+port+hexgrid: port trading, buttons are disabled if the current player doesn’t have the port. 4:1 is always enabled.
- [ ] ui+port+hexgrid: port trading, can’t get or give more or less than defined by the port type (3:1, 2:1).
- [ ] ui+port: port trading, don’t allow n for 0 trades
- [ ] ui: large indicator off what the current player is (and what the order is)
- [ ] ui: cancelling of roads/settlements/cities while placing
- [ ] ui+catanlog: save log file to custom location on End Game
- [ ] ui: images, colors in UI buttons (eg dice for roll, )
- [ ] ui: city-shaped polygon for cities
- [ ] ui: tile images instead of colored hexagons
- [ ] ui: port images instead of colored triangles
- [ ] ui: piece images instead of colored polygons
- [ ] ui: number images instead of text (or avoid contrast issues otherwise)
- [ ] ui: roll frame: up on 12 goes to 2
- [ ] ui+game+states+steal: steal dropdown has “nil” option always, for in case it goes on a person with no cards and no steal happens. Name it something obvious, don’t use an empty string.
