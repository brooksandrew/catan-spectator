Transcribe games of Settlers of Catan for research purposes, replay purposes, broadcast purposes, etc.

This project introduces a machine-parsable, human-readable file format for describing a game of Catan.

This is a work in progress.

### Usage

```
$ python3 main.py --help
usage: main.py [-h] [--terrain TERRAIN] [--numbers NUMBERS] [--ports PORTS]
               [--pieces PIECES] [--pregame PREGAME]

log a game of catan

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --terrain TERRAIN  random|preset|empty|debug, default empty
  --numbers NUMBERS  random|preset|empty|debug, default empty
  --ports PORTS      random|preset|empty|debug, default preset
  --pieces PIECES    random|preset|empty|debug, default empty
  --pregame PREGAME  on|off, default on
```

Make targets:
- `make relaunch`: launch (or relaunch) the GUI
- `make logs`: dump the python logs to stdout
- `make tail`: tail the python logs
- `make`: alias for `make relaunch`

### Demo

### File Format

Each `.catan` file contains all publicly known information in the game.
Therefore, each `.catan` file contains sufficient information to 'replay' a game (from a spectator's point of view).

The header begins with a version, and ends with `...CATAN!`. The game begins after that.

The format is not yet v1.0.

```
