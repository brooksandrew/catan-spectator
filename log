This project was originally stored in a mercurial repo that contains several
small scripts and projects. Because the repo, and therefore the commit graph,
includes other scripts it's not straightforward to convert to git. I therefore
ported the script as-is, and include the original commit log here for posterity.

Now uses a fixed connected path around the graph (as defined in the Catan
manual) so don't need to work a way to traverse the graph that visits every
node.  Add docstrings and a basic test.

Color ports and make randomization optional. Color the canvas
background. Refactor the Options class and autogenerate the checkboxes from the
available options.

Change the tile order to be the same as given in the Catan manual - starting
from the top-left corner and circling counter-clockwise from the outside in.
Adjust the ports similarly, and draw them as triangles instead of hexes.  Adjust
colors.  Change the number list so it's in the order given by the game (ie A-R),
ready for use unshuffled in the fair-number algorithm.

Numerous improvements

1. Better numbering of tiles and more robust and flexible rendering algorithm.
2. Detect and prevent to red numbers being placed next to each other.
3. Refactored into classes.
4. Add button to generate a new board.

First cut of a tool to create random catan boards.

Randomizes the tiles and draws them to screen in the correct board shape. The
algorithm to get the tile positions is hand-adjusted, this needs to be automated
using math.
